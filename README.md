### "Update Notifier"
made by Jaehyeok Choi

## Welcome to Jaehyeok's Final Project For OSS Lab!

This git is for open source codes for final project for OSS Lab class.
Please feel free to look up the source codes for your use.
I use pytesseract, open cv , mss.

## What does this project do?

"Update Notifier" is a program that sends a mail to user if there is a change in the section that user select.
It has another function to extract the text in image.
User can select the section in his/her moniter and this program will extract the text in the selected section.


## Why is this project useful?

Students in handong have to check notification very fast.
We might miss the important notification if we don't care about notification.
This program will automatically check the changes in the section that user selected, 
and send the mail to the user!

While students doing there homework or project, We use copy and paste a lot.
However, some website block copy through drag.
In that case, we have to write every words by our hands.
This program will solve those kinds of inconvenience.
